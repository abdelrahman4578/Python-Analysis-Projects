# Bitcoin Price Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is a simple yet insightful analysis of Bitcoin price trends using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as `pandas` and `matplotlib`. The goal is to visualize and understand how Bitcoin's value has changed over time and highlight significant periods in its price history.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Data Collection**: Historical Bitcoin price data is collected from a reliable source or API.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned and structured for analysis.

- **Data Analysis**: Bitcoin price trends are visualized using various plots and graphs.

- **Key Insights**: Important periods in Bitcoin's price history are highlighted, and relevant insights are derived.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries if not already installed:

   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the analysis.

4. Run the notebook cells to perform the analysis and visualize the Bitcoin price trends.

## Results

The project provides insights into Bitcoin price behavior over time, including:

- Visualization of Bitcoin price changes.
- Highlighting significant periods (e.g., price peaks and declines).
- Analysis of rolling averages for a smoother price trend view.
