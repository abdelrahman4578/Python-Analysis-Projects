# Laptop Price Analysis with Python

## Overview

This project utilizes Python for analyzing laptop prices. The dataset contains essential attributes like price, brand, type, screen resolution, CPU, RAM, GPU, screen size, operating system, and weight. The analysis is divided into three key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** We start by ensuring data integrity, handling missing values, and addressing outliers. Clean data is fundamental for meaningful analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering:** We create new features from existing data to uncover deeper insights that can influence laptop prices.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we explore relationships between various laptop features, understand price distributions, and unveil essential market trends.
